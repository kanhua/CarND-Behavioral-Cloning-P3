# Behavioral Cloning



## Training data set

### Augmentation and Selection of the data

#### Three cameras
I use all the three cameras to train the data. During the training, the model randomly select a camera image among the three. I added +/- 0.14 of steering values to the cameras. 

#### Flip the images horizontally

#### Resampling the data

The distribution of steering values is very unbalanced. 


### Preparation of the training dataset

I found the quality of training data is very critical to the success of enabling the car to finish the entire lap. Good quality data





## Models

I use the NVidia model to train the data.
The overall modeling flow is illustrated as the following
